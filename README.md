# Nmap

When it comes to hacking, knowledge is power. The more knowledge you have about a target system or network, the more options you have available. This makes it imperative that proper enumeration is carried out before any exploitation attempts are made.

## Why Nmap?

The short answer is that it's currently the industry standard for a reason: no other port scanning tool comes close to matching its functionality (although some newcomers are now matching it for speed).

It is an extremely powerful tool â€“ made even more powerful by its scripting engine which can be used to scan for vulnerabilities, and in some cases even perform the exploit directly!
